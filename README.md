# Lab Assignment 11

Please read the following instructions to complete the lab assignment.  

1. File structure:

    a. `run.py` - This is the file with a template where you can make changes to answer the questions in the assignment. You should implement the classes in the assignment alongside all their attributes and methods and test if they work as expected or not.

    b. `tests.py` - This file is used to run your code on some public test cases and check if your code is working as expected (in addition to the public test cases we will run a set of tests on our end to make sure your code works correctly). _DO NOT_ make any changes to this file.

    c. `.github/` - Make sure you _DO NOT_ edit any of the files in the shared `./github` folder and do not commit any files or changes to the files that are not listed in this repository already (no additional files are required)

2. If you would like to test the functions on your local machine before submitting (or committing) the assignment, you can use the following functions in your console/terminal/powershell:  

- Setup
```console
python -m pip install pytest
```
- Testing
```console
pytest tests.py
```  


3. After making your changes, make sure that you commit (`git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"`) and push (`git push`) your changes to save your code on GitHub. Your code will then be tested automatically on each commit that you push to our GitHub Classroom remote server. You can check the results under the "Actions" tab. Go to: _Actions_ -> _<your_most_recent_commit_message>_ -> _Autograding_ -> _Run education/autograding@v1_ to see the score (how many points you received or if there were any errors).
